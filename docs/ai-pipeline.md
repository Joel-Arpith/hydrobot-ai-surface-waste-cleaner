# AI Pipeline (YOLOv8)

HydroBot uses YOLOv8 for real-time object detection of floating surface waste.

Pipeline:
1. Image capture from onboard camera
2. Preprocessing and resizing
3. YOLOv8 inference
4. Bounding box extraction
5. Waste classification
6. Navigation decision based on detection confidence

The AI pipeline prioritizes efficiency and accuracy to minimize unnecessary motion and energy usage.
